                                At UTC, I applied for the Honors College's Innovations in Honors program and graduated as an Innovation Scholar in 2020. The Innovations program requires each student to participate in a two-semester Innovation Lab where students use Design Thinking to find and solve problems in Chattanooga. The Rebecca Jones class decided to center on problems in education.
                                <br><br>
                                Early on in research, my team decided to focus on Technical Education. Technical Education is the under-utilized sector of jobs that use hands-on skills for careers, such as construction, electrical-systems-repairing, massaging, diesel truck driving, airplane piloting, etc. These skills are specialized abilities that require dedicated facilities to teach, which relegates the education of these jobs to "Techincal Schools" or secondary majors in some Universities. Most students are led to believe that the standard University pathway is the only way to gain a successful career, but Technical certifications are just as good, are in higher demand, and take less time to copmlete.
                                <br><br>
                                To support this under-represented side of the education system, the Hamilton County Department of Education established the Future Ready Institutes as programs in Chattanooga high schools to teach these skills to students as early as possible. Our project in the UTC Innovation Lab was to help develop ways to market to high-schoolers the importance and benefits of the Future Ready Institutes.
                                <br><br>
                                <br><br>

                                <br>
                                The Innovation Lab taught me the basics of Design Thinking and the value of rapid prototyping. I worked with professionals and students outside my regular field and discovered my own limits compared to a large-scale project like the Future-Ready Institutes. I learned a lot, and I plan to take my abilities in Design Thinking with me to whatever career I find myself in.

                                The Honors College at UTC requires each student write a Departmental Honors Thesis for their senior year. For my project, I researched the field of Computing Ethics. Specifically, the ethical perspectives of professionals in software development and curation. When a developer, security consultant, or operations specialist makes any decision about a product, that decision comes from what that programmer values and, given a buildup of similar choices, can affect the project. Disasters like Cambridge Analytica mass-downloading information from Facebook, as well as employee walk-outs and marches like the march by Uber drivers demanding better pay, show that there are major concerns for the held ethical values of programmers.
                                <br><br>
                                My research examines on the results of an Ethical Values Survey for Computer Professionals. The survey has 10 scenarios, each one setting one pair of values against each other to discover whether respondents would treat one principle as more valuable than another, or whether they treat them both as neutral. The principles tested are:
                                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                    <li>Transparency to the Client</li>
                                    <li>Ensuring Product Quality</li>
                                    <li>Respect of Privacy</li>
                                    <li>Respect of Intellectual Property</li>
                                    <li>Helping Colleagues.</li>
                                </ul>
                                From early on in development, I named the research "Mutual Exclusion," to represent the difficulty in choosing between two values placed in opposing positions. By placing these values against each other, I could learn how an ethical principle is valued relative the others.
                                <br><br>
                                Data collection officially closed February 13th, 2020, with a total of 90 responses from local professionals in computing. The data confirmed several major discoveries for programmers in south-east Tennessee:
                                <br><br>
                                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                    <li>Most programmers seem to value their coworkers more than the good of a singular project</li>
                                    <li>Older programmers care even more about coworkers than younger respondents do</li>
                                    <li>Respondents out of college are more likely to value releasing a project quickly, even at the expense of quality or privacy</li>
                                    <li>Respondents out of college are more likely to value intellectual property, while students are more likely to respect privacy</li>
                                    <li>Older programmers and non-students value clients more than younger students</li>
                                </ul>
                                Most of these results match common understandings of programming (such as more experienced programmers being more beholden to their bosses), but it is significant that all programmers, especially older ones, value their coworkers, or at least treat it as the ethical thing to do. This shows that, contrary to the stereotype, programmers are not predisposed to live in solitude or to be antisocial. Programmers feel a responsibility to their colleagues.

                                My senior thesis was a traipse into wildly unfamiliar territory. I developed an ethics survey, comparing the pros and cons of several survey-distribution services, I built an external service in Heroku. I wrote several scenarios and ethical dillemas before selecting the 10 most best ones. I championed my survey, reaching out to city leaders and companies. I compiled the data using Python. I learned advanced topics in statistics such as power, correlation, and conditional distributions. I drafted, rewrote, and defending my thesis in front of my faculty advisory board. Through my experience writing my thesis, I played many roles and gained experience in many fields. I am glad that I pushed myself to write a senior thesis, because I learned more about myself and the wide variety of jobs a single project requires than I ever could have in a class. I was forced to take my studies beyond the classroom into the city of Chattanooga, and that increased my networking skills and flexibility as a programmer.
